This repository provides information on the data used for a user study that will be discussed in an upcoming publication.

The anonymized version of the data recorded via the user study can be found in the file "user_study_data.csv". All analyses presented in the publication were obtained using this data.

The source code for the COLIBRI VR project, that was used to generate the immersive virtual environments for the study, is also accessible as open-source. More information can be found on the official documentation website for the project: https://caor-mines-paristech.github.io/colibri-vr.
