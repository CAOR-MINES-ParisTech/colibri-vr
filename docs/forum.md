We've been having trouble monitoring the forum this past year to answer your questions. If you want to get quick answers concerning a problem you're facing, our advice is to submit an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/CAOR-MINES-ParisTech/colibri-vr-unity-package/issues) instead. To engage in more general discussions on the topic, you can still send messages on the forum, but we may not answer ourselves very regularly.
